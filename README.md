# The art of fine tuning
This repository includes a combination of how to fine tune different large language models with different datasets

## Abstract

This study explores the enhancement of automatic scoring systems through the fine-tuning of ChatGPT (GPT-3.5), with a focus on student-written responses in the educational sector. By leveraging a dataset comprising middle-school and high-school student responses across various science assessments, we fine-tuned GPT-3.5 to improve its scoring accuracy significantly. The process involved domain-specific adjustments to the model, demonstrating the potential of large language models in educational applications. Our findings highlight GPT-3.5's superior performance in automatic scoring tasks compared to traditional models, marking a step forward in the integration of AI in educational assessment.
